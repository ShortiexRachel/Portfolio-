# Hi, I'm Preethi Anandhakumar
Welcome to my ICS4U portfolio. I’ll use this site to post my work and reflections.

## Highlights
- 🔧 Project 1: *ex. Brownie's Internet Safety* – *A website that contains helpful links for people who have been exploited online and a fun interactive Would You Rather Game about internat safety online*
- 🧠 Concept I learned: *I learned how important it is as a student to learn about the dangers of the internet befoehand and how to prevent myself from being in danger. I hope this website I made helps other students who have been impacted to receive help from important websites I've gathered and categorized.*

## About me
I am a 16 year old female who goes to Port Credit Secondary School. I love to crochet clothes and granny squares. I was on the varsity badminton team last year. I also play the piano and I love dogs. I hope to explore the technology and science fields in highschool so that I can persue it in post-seconday.
