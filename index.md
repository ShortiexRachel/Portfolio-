## About me
I am a 16 year old female who goes to Port Credit Secondary School. I love to crochet clothes and granny squares. I was on the varsity badminton team last year. I also play the piano and I love dogs. I hope to explore the technology and science fields in highschool so that I can persue it in post-seconday.
