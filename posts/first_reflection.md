# First Reflection
What I learned this week (bullets are fine, you may include an image):
I learned how to make a fully functioning website with Ms. Kim and my friends on Github. We learned how to add links to take website users to another page. We also explored various themes to use for the website.
- Topic(s): Internet Safety, Digital Citizenship
- What I struggled with: When changing to a specific theme, it didn't work. The rlstevenson-jekyll-theme was supposed to change our theme to a light/dark brown. This didn't work and instead created more problems in our code.
- What Iâ€™m proud of: I am proud that my group and I made a game using our knowledge of coping links and interactive questions.
- Next steps: I want to try and add pictures that relate to our topic. This would the website more visually pleasing.
